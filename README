PyoRhythm
=========

Various biorhythm computation scripts for Python 3. Matplotlib is required for some of them.
Graphical output is shown on the screen and written to PDFs (in the working directory).

* for a single person:
----------------------

bioplot.py:
  Plot a chart for the next 31 days (all rhythms)

bioyear.py:
  Plot biorhythm chart for a whole year (primary rhythms)

biowarn.py:
  Create a "traffic light"-style HTML page of critical/mini-critical warnings, like the
  1970s Kosmos-1 biorhythm calculator

biocal.py:
  Create a PDF with a whole-year biorhythm calendar (requires the ReportLab module)

conky/bioconky.py:
  Modified version of biowarn.py that outputs Conky markup

* for two or more people (biorhythmic matching/compatibility):
--------------------------------------------------------------

bio_imdb.py:
  Compute compatibility between two persons. Birthday information is taken either from IMDb, a built-in list, or directly via a date on the commandline.

biocompat.py:
  Compute biorhythmic compatibility between two persons (using primary and I-Ching rhythms)

compattable.py:
  Compute a compatibility score for each pair in a group of people and
  print a table of results

biomatch.py:
  Show dates on which nobody in a given group has a critcal or mini-critical day

kosmos_astro.py:
  Computes partner compatibility like the Kosmos Astro
